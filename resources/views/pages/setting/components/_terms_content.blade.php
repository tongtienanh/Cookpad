                        and
                    </li>
                    <li>if you are not an experienced cook, we advise that you take instruction from an experienced

                <p><strong>Premium Service Subscribed to via Our App: Subscription Fees.</strong> If you subscribe to

                    shall be due unless your subscription is cancelled in accordance with Section 9.</p>

                    the Subscription Fee by a payment method as may be designated by us or our payment processor time to
                    time. The payment method may vary depending on your location and whether you subscribe to the

                <p><strong>Payment for Premium Service Subscribed to via Our App.</strong> You can subscribe to the
                    Premium Service from our App (<a
                        href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/2476088?hl=en-GB">Android</a> / <a
                        href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202023">iOS</a>). By providing payment processor
                    authorised by Google Inc. or Apple Inc. (“Authorised Payment Processor”) with the details of a
                    payment method, you (i) promise that you are authorised to use the payment method that you provided;
                    (ii) promise that any payment information you provide is true and accurate; and (iii) authorise the
                    Authorised Payment Processor to take payment of the Subscription Fees on a recurring monthly basis
                    until your subscription to the Premium Service is cancelled by you as described in Section 9, or is
                    terminated by us in accordance with these Terms of Service. You must keep the details for your
                    chosen payment method up to date, and ensure there are enough funds to cover the cost of the
                    Subscription Fees. To change your payment information, please refer to the following pages: <a
                        href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/7018481?hl=en-GB">Android</a> / <a

                    updated information to collect payment from you. Changes made to your payment information will not
                    apply to Subscription Fees that were already submitted for payment.</p>

                <p><strong>Third-Party Charges.</strong> We or our payment processor are not responsible for any charges
                    or fees imposed by your bank, credit or debit card issuer, or other account provider on payment of
                    the Subscription Fees or any costs that may be incurred as a result of failed attempts to take such
                    payment. We or our payment processor may re-attempt to take payment at any time. If we cannot take
                    successful payment we may terminate or suspend your use of the Premium Service, however you will
                    still owe us Subscription Fees up until the point of termination or suspension and (in the case of
                    suspension) for the period during which your account is suspended, to the extent permitted by
                    applicable laws. We or our payment processor may contact you if your bank, card issuer or other
                    account provider declines payment of the Subscription Fees or refuses to authorise a recurring
                    payment for the Subscription Fees.</p>

                <p><strong>Changes to the Fees.</strong> We may increase or decrease the Subscription Fees at any time
                    in our sole discretion (including the introduction of charges for aspects of the Premium Service
                    that were previously provided at no extra cost) and in that case, we will notify you reasonably in
                    advance the price change takes effect, such as by sending you email or by a message displayed
                    through the Cookpad Service. If you do not agree to the changed Subscription Fees, you may cancel
                    your subscription to the Premium Service within thirty (30) days after we notify you of the change.
                    If you do not cancel your subscription, then you will be deemed to have accepted the change and we
                    will start charging the amended Subscription Fee.</p>

                <p>As an optional feature, Cookpad may offer automated image classification that assists you in
                    uploading food-related images. If you choose to use this optional feature, the images available on
                    your device will be sent to our servers and automatically scanned using automated image recognition
                    software that attempts to identify which of your images are food-related. The images tentatively
                    identified as food-related will be presented to you on your private page at our App, which you only
                    have access to. You can manually remove unwanted images presented on the private page. Any images
                    that are not identified as food-related, or that you removed manually, will be deleted from
                    Cookpad’s servers.</p>
